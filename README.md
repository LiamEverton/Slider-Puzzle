# Slider-Puzzle
1st Year Undergradute - Lancaster University Final Assignment

##Overview

We were tasked with creating a "slider" game which consisted of spliting an image into several pieces to create a grid,
randomly moving these pieces around the grid and then tasking the user with rearranging the pieces to recreate the original image.

##Requirements

The only requirements given were that it had to function and only use the Swing library within Java.

No other libraries could be used, including JavaFX.
